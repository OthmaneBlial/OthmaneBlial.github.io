# Runtime And Capabilities

## Runtime Shape

RustFrame is not trying to be a full Tauri replacement. The current workspace intentionally stays small:

- The desktop shell is built around `tao` and `wry`.
- Frontend assets are served from a custom `app://localhost/` protocol when embedded.
- Development can switch to an HTTP dev server through `RUSTFRAME_DEV_URL` or a `rustframe:dev-url` meta tag.
- The runtime injects a small promise bridge onto `window.RustFrame`, not through a localhost IPC server.

## App Metadata Comes Primarily From The Manifest

Frontend-only apps can add `apps/<name>/rustframe.json` for typed configuration:

```json
{
  "appId": "hello-rustframe",
  "window": {
    "title": "Hello Rustframe",
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 820
  },
  "security": {
    "model": "local-first"
  },
  "devUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
  "packaging": {
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "Hello RustFrame desktop package",
    "linux": {
      "icon": "assets/icon.svg",
      "categories": ["Utility"],
      "keywords": ["workflow", "local-first", "rustframe"]
    },
    "windows": {
      "icon": "assets/icon.ico"
    },
    "macos": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "dev.rustframe.hello-rustframe",
      "icon": "assets/icon.icns"
    }
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "roots": ["fixtures"]
  },
  "shell": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "name": "listFixtures",
        "program": "ls",
        "args": ["-la", "${SOURCE_APP_DIR}/fixtures"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

That manifest is now the primary typed contract for window settings, development URLs, capabilities, and packaging.
HTML fallback still works:

```html
<title>Hello Rustframe</title>
<meta name="rustframe:width" content="1280">
<meta name="rustframe:height" content="820">
<meta name="rustframe:dev-url" content="http://127.0.0.1:5173">
```

When both HTML metadata and `rustframe.json` set the same window fields, the manifest wins.
The same manifest also provides Linux, Windows, and macOS packaging metadata for `rustframe-cli package`.
`apps/research-desk/rustframe.json` is the flagship concrete example: it scopes a bundled `workspace/` and `tools/` directory plus allowlisted Python indexers without introducing an app-owned native project.

## Platform Validation

RustFrame now treats platform coverage as an explicit contract instead of a distant note.

- `rustframe-cli doctor` checks Cargo, Rust, and the host desktop dependencies before you build or package.
- `rustframe-cli platform-check <name>` validates the generated or ejected runner against the current host row in the Linux/Windows/macOS support matrix.
- Default matrix rows that require another native host are reported as such instead of being silently ignored or falsely marked as validated.
- `rustframe-cli package <name> --verify` builds a host-native bundle and validates the emitted metadata, scripts, and archive layout.

## Frontend Trust Model

RustFrame assumes a trusted frontend by default.

- `security.model = "local-first"` is the default. Configured database, filesystem, and shell bridges are exposed to the frontend.
- `security.model = "networked"` treats the frontend as less trusted. Only the window bridge stays exposed by default.
- `security.bridge.database`, `security.bridge.filesystem`, and `security.bridge.shell` can selectively re-enable those namespaces in `networked` mode.
- The runtime enforces that boundary both in the injected JS bridge and in native IPC dispatch, so raw `window.ipc.postMessage(...)` calls do not bypass it.
- `window.RustFrame.security` exposes the active trust model and the currently available bridge namespaces.

If your app loads remote content, embeds third-party scripts, renders user HTML, or has a meaningful XSS surface, use `networked` mode and keep the bridge scope minimal.

## Embedded Assets

When you run `dev`, `export`, or `package`, the CLI walks the app asset directory and embeds everything except:

- `dist/` at the app root
- hidden files and hidden folders

`index.html` is required.

## Native IPC Surface

The shipped bridge exposes these methods according to the active trust model:

### Window

- `window.RustFrame.window.id`
- `window.RustFrame.window.route`
- `window.RustFrame.window.isPrimary`
- `window.RustFrame.window.current()`
- `window.RustFrame.window.list()`
- `window.RustFrame.window.open(routeOrOptions, options?)`
- `window.RustFrame.window.close()`
- `window.RustFrame.window.minimize()`
- `window.RustFrame.window.maximize()`
- `window.RustFrame.window.setTitle(title)`

Secondary windows are still in-app windows:

- `window.open(...)` only accepts in-app routes, not absolute URLs.
- New windows share the same embedded assets or dev server, the same trust model, and the same filesystem, shell, and database capabilities.
- Each window keeps its own frontend state and its own JS heap.
- Database access is shared because all windows talk to the same runtime-owned database capability.
- `apps/research-desk` uses `/reader?doc=<id>` routes for focused review windows over the same local archive.

### Database

If the app contains `data/schema.json` and the frontend trust settings allow database access, RustFrame exposes:

- `window.RustFrame.db.info()`
- `window.RustFrame.db.get(table, id)`
- `window.RustFrame.db.list(table, options)`
- `window.RustFrame.db.search(table, term, options)`
- `window.RustFrame.db.count(table, options)`
- `window.RustFrame.db.insert(table, record)`
- `window.RustFrame.db.update(table, id, patch)`
- `window.RustFrame.db.delete(table, id)`

The runtime manages these record fields automatically:

- `id`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

Schema files, seed files, and versioned SQL migration files under `data/migrations/` are embedded into the app binary. The actual SQLite file is created in the user's app-data directory, not inside `dist/`.

Migration files:

- are discovered from `data/migrations/*.sql`
- are versioned by the numeric prefix in the filename, such as `002-rename-title.sql`
- run during upgrades before the runtime falls back to additive table reconciliation
- are the supported path for non-additive changes such as column renames, drops, type changes, and backfills

## Filesystem Capability

The runtime can expose read access to explicit directories through `allow_fs_root(...)`.
Frontend-only apps now declare those roots through `rustframe.json`.

- `window.RustFrame.fs.readText(path)` only succeeds inside the configured roots.
- `window.RustFrame.fs.listDir(path)`, `metadata(path)`, `writeText(path, contents)`, `writeBinary(path, base64)`, and `copyFrom(sourcePath, destinationPath)` stay inside the same scoped roots.
- `window.RustFrame.fs.openPath(path)` opens an allowed file or directory in the host default app.
- `window.RustFrame.fs.revealPath(path)` opens the host file manager for the allowed file or its parent folder.
- Parent escapes and absolute paths outside those roots are rejected.
- Relative roots resolve against the source app folder in debug builds and against the executable directory in release builds.
- `rustframe-cli export` and `rustframe-cli package` copy declared relative roots beside the executable or inside the host bundle so file-centric apps can ship local workspaces and helper tool directories.
- `${SOURCE_APP_DIR}`, `${SOURCE_ASSET_DIR}`, and `${EXE_DIR}` can be expanded inside declared values.

The bridge also exposes:

- `window.RustFrame.dialog.openFile(...)`
- `window.RustFrame.dialog.openFiles(...)`
- `window.RustFrame.dialog.openDirectory(...)`
- `window.RustFrame.dialog.saveText(...)`
- `window.RustFrame.dialog.saveBinary(...)`
- `window.RustFrame.clipboard.writeText(text)`

The capability demo previously wired this in Rust by hand; frontend-only apps can now do the same through the manifest.

## Shell Capability

The runtime can expose hardened commands through `allow_shell_command_configured(...)`.
Frontend-only apps declare the same controls through `rustframe.json`.

- `window.RustFrame.shell.exec(name, args)` resolves to structured `stdout`, `stderr`, `exitCode`, truncation flags, `timeoutMs`, and `maxOutputBytes`.
- Unknown commands are rejected.
- Frontend-provided extra args are denied by default and must be allowlisted per command.
- Commands run directly through `std::process::Command`, not through a shell pipeline.
- Each command can declare `cwd`, `env`, `clearEnv`, `timeoutMs`, and `maxOutputBytes`.
- `${SOURCE_APP_DIR}`, `${SOURCE_ASSET_DIR}`, and `${EXE_DIR}` can be used inside declared program, arg, cwd, and env values.
- `rustframe-cli dev <name>` writes shell audit records to `apps/<name>/dist/dev-shell-audit.log`.

## Trust Model

RustFrame only enables the bridge surface that the frontend trust settings and the resolved runtime capabilities allow.

- `local-first` is for apps that own local data and explicit machine access.
- `networked` is for apps that behave more like a hosted web app and should not assume local filesystem, shell, or database access.
- When a bridge is disabled, the runtime returns a permission-denied error instead of silently exposing a partial capability.

Typical examples:

- a `networked` frontend calling `window.RustFrame.db.list(...)` receives a database permission-denied error
- a frontend without filesystem roots calling `window.RustFrame.fs.readText(...)` receives a filesystem permission-denied error
- a frontend calling a shell command that was not allowlisted receives a shell permission-denied error

## Hidden Runner Generation

Frontend-only apps stay clean because the Rust runner is generated under:

```text
target/rustframe/apps/<name>/runner/
```

That runner:

- embeds the app assets
- injects the canonical `window.RustFrame` bridge at document start
- carries forward window metadata from `index.html` and optional overrides from `rustframe.json`
- wires in the database capability when `data/schema.json` exists
- wires in filesystem roots and shell commands declared in `rustframe.json`
- feeds Linux, Windows, and macOS package metadata from `rustframe.json` into `rustframe-cli package`
- is the runner that `rustframe-cli platform-check` validates

## Ejected Runner Path

When an app needs deeper native control, `rustframe-cli eject <name>` creates `apps/<name>/native/`.

That ejected runner:

- depends on the `rustframe` library instead of copying runtime code into the app
- embeds the app assets directly from the app folder through `rust-embed`
- becomes the runner used by `dev`, `export`, `platform-check`, and `package` for that app
- is the place to add extra native crates, deeper `tao` or `wry` setup, menus, tray work, or shortcuts

## Practical Summary

RustFrame's contract is simple on purpose:

- plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the app folder
- a tiny native bridge
- optional embedded SQLite
- optional scoped filesystem access
- optional allowlisted process execution
