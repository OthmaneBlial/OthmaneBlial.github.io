# Product demo provenance

The checked-in demo is a real Linux/KVM capture produced on GitHub Actions. It
uses the verified RustDroid `v0.3.2` candidate archive; no Android emulator or
KVM was installed on the maintainer's Mac.

## Evidence

| Android capture | [full capture run 34209082936](https://github.com/OthmaneBlial/rustdroid/actions/runs/34209082936) |

| Product binary source | `2754c3ee6fc3bb7795f0b2f0a8e100febb4be900` (demo candidate archive from [34205275762](https://github.com/OthmaneBlial/rustdroid/actions/runs/34205275762)); the matching published release is `v0.3.2` from `ce727e8` |

The raw capture is 115.36 seconds. The public export is 57.36 seconds,
1280×720, 25 fps, H.264 `yuv420p`, no audio, and 552 KiB. The export uses
FFmpeg's web-safe H.264 profile and `+faststart`. It keeps the real launch,
classified missing-launcher failure, and generated HTML report. Setup and
variable waits are excluded or time-compressed; the captions say when that
happens. The edit script is [`scripts/edit-product-demo.sh`](../../scripts/edit-product-demo.sh).

The final MP4 is a checked-in copy of the green edit-only artifact. The project
site player is ready and the README keeps a fallback download; GitHub strips a
relative README `<video>` tag, so a maintainer upload is still required for a
native README player. The raw capture and all runtime receipts remain in the
linked Actions artifact for the same run (subject to GitHub's artifact
retention policy).
