# Register machine, objects and garbage collection

Primary input contracts: [DEX format](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dex-format)
and [Dalvik bytecode](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dalvik-bytecode).
Implementation belongs to DROIDLESS, not these reference implementations.

Standalone DEX 035/037/038/039/040 is accepted. Container 041, reverse endian,
optimized/quickened DEX and newer invoke forms are rejected. The parser checks
magic, header/whole-file size, SHA-1, Adler-32, table ranges and referenced IDs.
Class members use delta indexes. Code items retain register counts, instructions,
try ranges/catch handlers and debug offset. Annotations/debug programs are not
fully decoded. This is not a full bytecode verifier.

## Frame and value semantics

One register is a 32-bit primitive word or a typed managed handle. Long/double use
two adjacent low/high words, including in argument lists. Input registers occupy
the final `ins_size` positions in `registers_size`. Each call has its own PC,
register file, invoke result and pending exception. Errors retain method/DEX/PC.

Integer overflow wraps, shifts mask counts, float/double arithmetic uses IEEE
operations and numeric conversions follow the current Rust/Java-compatible
saturation rules. Arithmetic edge tests and compiled Java exercise actual D8
instructions rather than a parallel calculator implementation.

Execution stops after five million instructions per launch/input/close transaction
or 128 frames. Unsupported opcodes fail rather than acting as successful NOPs.
Monitors are only meaningful under the current single guest thread.

## Classes and objects

Instances hold descriptor plus fields keyed by declaring class/name/type. Arrays
retain component type and words. Static fields are independent roots, initialized
from encoded values before `<clinit>`. A class is marked initializing to prevent
recursive entry. Initialization failure is a terminal error; a complete erroneous-
class state machine is pending. Basic inheritance/virtual/interface dispatch is
tested; transitive interface/array covariance rules are incomplete.

Explicit throw propagates a guest reference and searches parsed catch handlers
in the current frame and callers. Host-generated faults such as divide-by-zero/
null/bounds failures are currently terminal diagnostics, not universally catchable
Java exceptions. This distinction must remain visible until corrected.

## Heap

Handles are monotonically allocated and never reused, preventing stale aliases.
Mark/sweep roots include active Activity/content View, statics, interned strings
and frames. Traversal follows object fields, arrays, View children and listeners.
Collection occurs between input callbacks; no automatic in-frame collection,
moving/generational collector or finalization exists.

Bounds include one million lifetime handles, one million array elements and one
MiB per guest string. These do not enforce overall resident memory: nested arrays
and metadata can still be expensive. `--heap-stats` reports actual object and
collection counts, not inferred peak bytes. Reachability/reclamation tests run
without Android.
