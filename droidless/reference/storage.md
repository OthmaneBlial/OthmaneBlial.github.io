# Persistent preferences

Current source implements bounded `SharedPreferences`, SQLite and package-confined
file I/O subsets. v0.2.0 added private file input; v0.3.0 adds bounded output
and channel transfers. Private files/cache directory metadata are modeled.
Preference listeners, String sets and unrestricted host file access remain
unsupported.

## Host-selected data root

The CLI persists preferences by default below:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/DROIDLESS/apps/<package>/`
- Other hosts: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/droidless/apps/<package>/`, falling back to
  `~/.local/share/droidless/apps/<package>/`. Linux execution is unverified.

`--data-dir APPS_ROOT` selects another host-approved root. `--ephemeral` disables
disk access and keeps values in this runtime only; the options are mutually
exclusive. The Rust API `Runtime::new` remains ephemeral; `with_data_dir` explicitly
grants the chosen directory capability. Manifest permissions grant no host access.

## Virtual external directory

Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory returns the virtual path
`/storage/emulated/0`. Directory operations map it to
`APPS_ROOT/<package>/external/` through the same package directory capability as
private storage. Subdirectories persist with `--data-dir`; ephemeral runtimes
retain directory metadata in memory only. Paths are normalized before mapping,
and other virtual users, traversal outside the volume and symlink traversal are
rejected. A second package sees its own external directory.

This is DROIDLESS's app-isolated external-volume profile; Android's cross-app
shared media storage and host home/Downloads access are not provided. Returning
the directory does not make backup/restore or general Java file I/O work.

## Bounded file input

FileInputStream constructors accepting a String or File can read regular files
inside the current package's private or virtual external directory. The existing
directory capability opens every parent and file without following symlinks;
special files, hard links, missing files and paths outside the package fail with
FileNotFoundException. Reads snapshot at most 64 MiB at construction, so later
file replacement does not change that stream. Existing read/skip/available/close
behavior applies to the snapshot. Ephemeral runtimes have no disk file access;
the bounded virtual `/proc/self/cmdline` file remains available. Live host
descriptors remain unsupported.

FileInputStream.getChannel returns one retained FileChannel for that stream.
The read-only snapshot channel exposes size, shared position, isOpen and close.
Seeking changes subsequent stream reads; seeking beyond EOF preserves size and
returns EOF on reading. Negative positions fail. Closing either object closes
the other, with catchable ClosedChannelException from closed channel operations.
Compiled DEX checks cover wide positions, interface identity, aliasing, faults
and collection of the source/channel cycle. FileChannel ByteBuffer I/O, mapping,
locking and interruptible descriptor operations remain unsupported.

## Bounded file output and channel transfers

FileOutputStream accepts String and File paths inside the package's private or
virtual external directory. It can replace or append to regular files and writes
at most 64 MiB. Bytes remain staged until flush or close, then use the existing
atomic storage writer. An abandoned unclosed stream leaves the old file intact.
The path checks reject traversal, links, special files and host paths.

Its FileChannel shares position, size and close state with the stream. Bounded
`transferFrom` and `transferTo` connect the modeled input and output channels;
stream reads/writes and channel position changes stay in sync. `File.listFiles`
and `listFiles(FileFilter)` return only safe entries from the same package space,
with guest filter callbacks for the latter. The original Notepad 1.0.0 APK now
backs up its SQLite database byte-for-byte and restores it after a test copy is
tampered. SQLite integrity, every Note/Folder row and a fresh-process display
are verified. Its callback then calls unsupported `System.exit(0)` after the
restore has completed; process-shutdown parity remains open.

## API behavior

Context.getSharedPreferences and Activity.getPreferences accept MODE_PRIVATE only.
Stores are cached per name and kept alive across Activity transitions/GC. String,
int, long, float (including NaN bit patterns) and boolean values support typed
getters/defaults, contains, edit, remove and clear. A wrong getter type throws a
catchable ClassCastException. putString(key, null) removes the key.

Editor changes stay staged until commit/apply. Clear runs before every staged put,
regardless of call order, following the
[Android Editor contract](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.Editor).
Commit updates memory and returns whether disk persistence succeeded; a failed
write retains in-memory values and reports a diagnostic. Apply currently performs
the same synchronous write and discards the boolean result. Asynchronous disk
writes require the future scheduling subsystem. Concurrent processes are not
coordinated; last successful write wins.

## Storage boundary

Only a validated ASCII package identifier reaches directory lookup. A private
`.droidless-package` identity file rejects case-colliding package names instead
of sharing data on case-insensitive hosts. Preference names are 1–120 ASCII
letters/digits/`._-$`, excluding dot/dot-dot; hex encoding keeps `case` and `CASE`
distinct. Files use DROIDLESS JSON schema 1, not Android XML.

Opened `cap-std` directory handles keep operations under the selected package.
Package/prefs directories and data/identity files reject symlinks; regular-file
checks reject special files and Unix hard links. Reads are capped at 1 MiB; damaged
or unsupported files fail instead of being reset. Writes use an exclusively
created temporary file, sync, atomic rename and directory sync on Unix. Only the
writer's own temporary file is eligible for cleanup. New directories/files use
0700/0600 on Unix. Limits: 128 open stores, 16,384 entries per store, 1 MiB per file.

These are tested I/O boundaries, not an audited OS sandbox. Host access to the
same directory, package impersonation by another APK and simultaneous processes
are outside the current trust model. Use trusted APKs and a private apps root.

## Reproduce the authored fixture

```sh
target/release/droidless run --headless --data-dir artifacts/preferences-demo \
  fixtures/generated/preferences.apk --click "Edit note" \
  --input "This note survives restart" --click "Save note"
target/release/droidless run --headless --data-dir artifacts/preferences-demo \
  fixtures/generated/preferences.apk
```

`examples/preferences` is DROIDLESS-authored Java/XML conformance, not independent
notes-app compatibility. Restart, typed values, staged edits, failed saves,
corruption, case aliases and path/link isolation have executable regressions.

## Limited SQLite support

The runtime stores SQLite databases under the same per-package app-data root.
Its current bridge covers `SQLiteOpenHelper`, `execSQL`, transactions,
`compileStatement` binding/execution, `ContentValues` updates, `rawQuery`, and
typed cursor reads. This is a method subset, not general Android database
compatibility. The unchanged Notepad APK saves two edited titles, and both
`Note` rows survive a fresh process. The Notes screen renders both titles after
Back and after a fresh process restart. A native AppKit run also confirmed
keyboard text entry and saving through the APK's own flow.
`tools/compatibility.py` checks this flow against the pinned upstream APK.

The same probe now reopens an existing note through its own row listener, changes
its title and multiline plain-text body, dispatches Back, and checks that the
list refreshes. The original row ID remains unchanged and there are still two
rows. A fresh process reopens the revised note with both edited fields intact.
CLI `--input-at 1 TEXT` selects the second enabled visible editor field; like
`--input`, it edits the View model and does not synthesize keyboard events.
Separate native checks now select an existing row with the mouse, type both
fields, save with Escape and reopen them in a fresh process. The row keeps its
original ID. [Native evidence](verification.md#current-source-editing-an-existing-public-note).
